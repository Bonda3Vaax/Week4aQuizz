# Week4aQuizz

## Info

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

```

I have attempted this project to better understand the vast use of JavaScript.

I have a better understanding of the JavaScript grammar however when it comes to the practical part, there is a lot of information to remember, therefore more time and practise is required to master it. 

This project helped sharpening my skills and had fun doing it.
